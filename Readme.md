# TITAN FS: Distributed File System (DFS) in Go

## Overview

This project is a robust distributed file system (DFS) implemented in Go, designed to provide high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance for storing and managing files across a distributed network of nodes. The system is designed to handle large volumes of data, ensuring data integrity, redundancy, and efficient access and retrieval.

## Features

- **Scalability**: Easily add or remove nodes to/from the system without downtime.
- **High Availability**: Data is replicated across multiple nodes to prevent data loss in case of node failures.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The system can recover from hardware failures and continue operating without losing data.
- **Efficient Data Distribution**: Data is distributed across nodes to balance load and optimize access speed.
- **Security**: Secure communication between nodes and clients, ensuring data privacy and integrity.

## Components of the Distributed File System

### 1. **Master Node**
   - **Responsibilities**: 
     - Maintain the metadata of all files stored in the system, including file locations, node status, and replication information.
     - Handle client requests for file uploads, downloads, and metadata queries.
     - Manage the distribution of data across nodes and ensure proper replication.
   - **Components**:
     - Metadata Service: Stores and manages file metadata.
     - Load Balancer: Distributes client requests evenly across data nodes.
     - Replication Manager: Ensures that data is replicated across multiple nodes.

### 2. **Data Nodes**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Store the actual file data.
     - Communicate with the master node to receive commands and report status.
     - Handle read/write operations requested by the master node or clients.
   - **Components**:
     - Storage Service: Manages storage of file chunks.
     - Replication Service: Syncs data with other nodes for redundancy.
     - Health Monitor: Reports node health status to the master node.

### 3. **Client**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Interface with the DFS to upload, download, and manage files.
   - **Components**:
     - Client SDK/API: Provides methods for interacting with the DFS.
     - CLI/GUI: Optional tools for users to interact with the DFS.

### 4. **Networking Layer**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Facilitate communication between nodes and clients.
     - Ensure secure, reliable, and fast data transmission.
   - **Components**:
     - RPC Framework: Handles remote procedure calls between nodes.
     - Encryption Module: Secures data transmission.
     - Routing Service: Manages the routing of requests to appropriate nodes.

### 5. **Distributed Consensus**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Ensure consistency across the distributed system.
     - Manage leader election and failover processes.
   - **Components**:
     - Consensus Algorithm (e.g., Raft or Paxos): Ensures that all nodes agree on the system state.
     - Leader Election: Handles the selection of a master node in case of failure.

### 6. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Monitor the health and performance of the system.
     - Log all activities for auditing and debugging purposes.
   - **Components**:
     - Monitoring Service (e.g., Prometheus): Tracks performance metrics.
     - Logging Service: Collects and stores logs from all nodes.
     - Alerting System: Notifies administrators of any issues.

### 7. **Storage Management**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Efficiently manage disk space across the nodes.
   - **Components**:
     - Garbage Collection: Cleans up unused or outdated data.
     - Disk Balancer: Ensures even distribution of data across available storage.

## How to Achieve a Robust DFS

### 1. **Design Considerations**
   - **Redundancy**: Implement data replication across multiple nodes to prevent data loss.
   - **Sharding**: Split large files into smaller chunks to distribute across nodes.
   - **Consistency**: Use a consensus algorithm to maintain consistency across distributed nodes.
   - **Scalability**: Design the system to handle a growing number of nodes and data.
   - **Fault Tolerance**: Implement mechanisms to detect and recover from node failures.
   - **Security**: Ensure all data transmissions and storage are encrypted.

### 2. **Implementation Steps**
   - **Step 1**: Define the architecture and components of the DFS.
   - **Step 2**: Implement the master node to handle metadata, replication, and load balancing.
   - **Step 3**: Develop data nodes to manage file storage, replication, and communication with the master node.
   - **Step 4**: Create a client interface for interacting with the DFS.
   - **Step 5**: Implement networking and security protocols to facilitate communication between components.
   - **Step 6**: Integrate a distributed consensus mechanism to maintain consistency.
   - **Step 7**: Set up monitoring and logging for system health and performance tracking.
   - **Step 8**: Test the system thoroughly under various scenarios to ensure robustness.

### 3. **Tools and Technologies**
   - **Go Language**: For writing the core logic and components.
   - **gRPC**: For efficient communication between distributed components.
   - **Consul/Zookeeper/Etcd**: For service discovery and configuration management.
   - **Prometheus**: For monitoring system performance.
   - **Docker/Kubernetes**: For containerization and orchestration of system components.
   - **TLS/SSL**: For securing communications.

## Conclusion

Building a robust distributed file system in Go requires careful consideration of system architecture, data management, and fault tolerance. By following the outlined approach and leveraging the right tools and technologies, you can create a scalable, reliable, and secure DFS capable of handling large-scale file storage and retrieval needs.
